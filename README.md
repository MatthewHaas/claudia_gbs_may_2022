# Analysis of Claudia's GBS data (May 2022)
Analysis of Claudia's GBS data from May 2022

The data can be found here: `/home/jkimball/data_delivery/umgc/2022-q2/220502_A00223_0826_AHJTHFDSX3/Kimball_Project_009/
`

We will be working in the [global scratch](https://www.msi.umn.edu/content/scratch-storage) directory so we don't consume our group's storage quota. Just reminder: If you want or need to check the amount of resources the group is using, type `groupquota -g jkimball` on the command line. (Really, `groupquota` is enough, but if `jkimball` isn't your primary group, you'll need to include the second part.<br><br>
The path to our working directory is: `/scratch.global/haasx092/claudia_gbs_may_2022`.

The overall GBS project (Kimball_Project_009) contains projects from multiple group members. Claudia's data begin with either "R" or "S" so we will take advantage of that in order to create a text file containing just her samples.
